showAIChatBot();

// Send a message
sendAIMessage();

// Ask quick questions
askQuickQuestion('How do I request leave?');
```

### Using AI Assistant Class

```javascript
// Initialize
window.aiAssistant = new AIAssistant(window.hrApp);

// Get performance analysis
const analysis = await window.aiAssistant.getPerformanceAnalysis(employeeId);

// Get training recommendations
const recommendations = await window.aiAssistant.getTrainingRecommendations(employeeId);

// Check attrition risk
const risk = await window.aiAssistant.checkAttritionRisk(employeeId);

// Get dashboard insights
const insights = await window.aiAssistant.getDashboardInsights();

// Natural language query
const result = await window.aiAssistant.askNaturalLanguageQuery('What is our headcount?');
```

## Authentication

All AI endpoints require JWT authentication:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
