## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

When suggesting enhancements:
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful
- List any potential drawbacks or considerations

### Contributing Code

Areas where contributions are especially welcome:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage improvements
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

Follow PEP 8 guidelines:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length of 79 characters for code
- Maximum line length of 72 characters for docstrings/comments
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

Example:
```python
def calculate_net_salary(basic_salary, allowances, deductions):
    """
    Calculate net salary based on components.
    
    Args:
        basic_salary (float): Base salary amount
        allowances (float): Total allowances
        deductions (float): Total deductions
        
    Returns:
        float: Net salary after allowances and deductions
    """
    return basic_salary + allowances - deductions
```

### Code Structure

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing project structure

### Database Models

- Use descriptive field names
- Add appropriate constraints (nullable, unique, etc.)
- Include relationships where appropriate
- Add `to_dict()` method for serialization

### API Endpoints

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return consistent JSON responses
- Include proper error handling
- Add request validation

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Write tests for bug fixes
- Follow the existing test structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases

Example:
```python
def test_create_employee_success(client, auth_headers):
    """Test successful employee creation with valid data"""
    response = client.post('/api/employees',
                          headers=auth_headers,
                          json={...})
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert 'id' in response.json()

def test_create_employee_duplicate_email(client, auth_headers):
    """Test employee creation fails with duplicate email"""
    response = client.post('/api/employees',
                          headers=auth_headers,
                          json={...})
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert 'error' in response.json()
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_employees.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_employees.py::test_create_employee
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Test all critical paths
- Test edge cases
- Test error handling
